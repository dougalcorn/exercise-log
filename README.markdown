My Exercise Log is a place to store your own exercise data. I rely
heavily on [RunKeeper](http://runkeeper.com) to log all my runs using
the GPS on my iPhone. Since I have so much data logged in RunKeeper, I
also manually log data for other exercise activities there as well
(such as swimming). I love RunKeeper and have no intention of quiting
or competing against them.

However, they don't really make my data as accessible as I'd like. I'm
invited from time to time to participate in other online exercise
communities like [dailymile](http://dailymile.com). My pain is having
to re-enter all my data from RunKeeper into this other community site.

This app is mainly to scrape my data from RunKeeper (since there's no
API for exporting it) and store it as a staging ground to push to
other services via an API or Mechanize or whatever. It's also a way
for me to have all my data in one place that I control and can
manipulate.
